    Consider the recovery graph $G = (V,E)$ of an $(n,k,r,t)$ LRC code $\C$.
    
    Consider the following coloring procedure of $V$.
    
    Start with $S \subseteq V$ and color it in som fixed color.
    
    For the remaining vertices: a vertex is colored if at least one of its recovering sets is completely colored.
    
    I.e., we color all vertices that can be recovered from $S$. We denote the set of colored vertices by $\cl(S)$ and call it the closure of S in G.
    
    Call $\card{\cl (S)} / \card{S}$ the expansion ratio of the set $S$.
